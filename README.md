## Project Purpose ##
  I decided to teach myself how to use TeX. This is for multiple reasons, the main one being that I'd like to produce professional looking reports and papers. The hope being that when I, eventually, get back into education (probably a part time masters or second bachelors course), I'll be able to produce reports and papers on par with thesis documents.
  The modular nature ot TeX lends itself to easy creation and maintainance of such reports and papers. Plus there is ZERO cost in creating such a document - traditionally, word WYSIWYG processors have either been expensive or bloated (and sometimes both).
  Some tell me that the proliferation of cloud services like Google's Drive will destroy any need for TeX, but I don't believe that. Show me a document that you can create on any word processor that looks as good as one created with TeX and I'll think about stopping my study of TeX.
  Anyway, this project is all about teaching myself to use the multitude of LaTeX packages and tools to create interesting, professional looking documents. For example, including Ruby Text for Japanese characters (chapter one of the project) is something that is not easily done on traditional word processors, but can be easily done with LaTeX in a few key strokes.

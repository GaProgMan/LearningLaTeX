%the document class command HAS to be the first thing in a LaTeX file. It takes
%the following format:
% \documentclass[options]{class}

\documentclass[11pt, a4paper, twoside]{report}

%document classes are:
%article	- for articles in journals, presentations, short reports, program
%			  documentation, etc.
%IEEEtran	- for articles in the IEEE transactions format.
%proc		- for proceedings (based on article)
%minimal	- only used for debugging purposes
%report	- for full reports, thesis documents, small books, etc.
%book	- for full books.
%slides	- for slides (uses big sans serif characters)
%memoir	- for writing full memoir-type books
%letter	- for writing letters
%beamer	- for writing presentations

%user packages can be loaded in the preamble only. They go in here in the following format:
% \usepackage[options]{package}

%including the package "epigraph" this will allow quotes to be added at the begining of each chapter
%or section.
\usepackage{epigraph}

%the following two usepackage statements MUST be included for the Japanese text found in
%chapterOne.tex to compile correctly.
\usepackage{CJKutf8}
\usepackage[overlap]{ruby}

%the following package is required for adding source code listings to a document. At the minute,
%there is a source code listing in the file chapterTwo.tex
\usepackage{listings}

\usepackage{url}
%the above package is used for parsing url text

\usepackage{mathtools}
%the above package is used to parse mathematicall chaaracters (used in abstract.tex)

%this area is called the "preamble"

\begin{document}

\title{A Selection of Examples of \LaTeX Code with Discussions}
\author {Jamie Taylor}
\maketitle

%\title, and \author are compulsory. If \date is omitted, LaTeX will put today's date in it's place
%the whole section has to be followed by \maketitle, otherwise it will never be formatted correctly.

\begin{abstract}

%the abstract goes in here.
% it can be renamed from "Abstract" to anything else by using the following command (before the
%\begin{abstract}, obviously):
% \renewcommand{\abstractname}{The New Name}

%the abstract can be loaded from another file, using the following command:
% \input{filename}
%the above command will add the contents of the file "filename.tex" into the current document
%without adding any page breaks

%  However, the following command will add the contents of a given file between two pagebreaks:
% \include{filename}

%I am going to include an abstract from a different file. That way, maintaining the layout of the
%main document will be easier.
\input{abstract}

\end{abstract}

%before my table of contents, I want to add a preface. It will be pulled in from the file preface.tex
\input{preface}

%the following line adds a toc to the document
\tableofcontents

%a list of tables and a list of figures can be added in the same way as the toc.
% \listoffigures
% \listoftables

%the rest of the file can be split into either chapters or sections. Chapter declarations take the
% following format:
% \chapter{Name of Chapter}

%whereas section declarations take the following format:
% \section{Name of Section}

%sections, parts and chapters are all added to the table of contents (is there is one) automatically.
%they are also numbered automatically. But to add one that doesn't appear in the toc and is not
%numbered, the following command is used:
% \section*{Name of Unreferenced, Non-Numbered Section}

%subsectionsa and subsubsections can be added in the same way:
% \sybsection{Name of Sub-Section}
% \subsubsection{Name of Sub-Sub-Section}

%the first chapter, as with the abstract, will be pulled in from another file. I will still use input, however.
%This is because the \chapter uses \cleardoublepage and \clearpage before adding a new chapter. So,
%there is no need to use \include, just yet.
\input{chapterOne}
\input{chapterTwo}

\end{document}

%everything after the end{document} command will be ignored by LaTeX when compiling to DVI

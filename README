Purpose of the project:		I decided to teach myself how to use TeX. This is
				for multiple reasons, the main one being that I'd
				like to produce professional looking reports and
				papers. The hope being that when I, eventually,
				get back into education (probably a part time
				masters or second bachelors course), I'll be able
				to produce reports and papers on par with thesis
				documents.
					The modular nature ot TeX lends itself to
				easy creation and maintainance of such reports and
				papers. Plus there is ZERO cost in creating such a
				document - traditionally, word WYSIWYG processors
				have either been expensive or bloated (and some-
				times both).
					Some tell me that the proliferation of
				cloud services like Google's Drive will destroy
				any need for TeX, but I don't believe that. Show me
				a document that you can create on any word proces-
				sor that looks as good as one created with TeX and
				I'll think about stopping my study of TeX.
					Anyway, this project is all about teaching
				myself to use the multitude of LaTeX packages and
				tools to create interesting, professional looking
				documents. For example, including Ruby Text for
				Japanese characters (chapter one of the project)
				is something that is not easily done on traditional
				word processors, but can be easily done with LaTeX
				in a few key strokes.

%	The document class command HAS to be the first thing in a LaTeX file. It takes
%	the following format:
%	\documentclass[options]{class}

%	The chosen options tell LaTeX to create a document using the Report class
%	which uses a4 paper, set to two sided and the font size shall be 11pt
\documentclass[11pt, a4paper, twoside]{report}

%	Some available document classes are:
%	article	- for articles in journals, presentations, short reports, program
%			  documentation, etc.
%	IEEEtran	- for articles in the IEEE transactions format.
%	proc		- for proceedings (based on article)
%	minimal	- only used for debugging purposes
%	report	- for full reports, thesis documents, small books, etc.
%	book		- for full books.
%	slides	- for slides (uses big sans serif characters)
%	memoir	- for writing full memoir-type books
%	letter		- for writing letters
%	beamer	- for writing presentations

%	User packages can be loaded in the preamble only. This means that all
%	packages that are required for the successful compilation of the document
%	need to be declared at the very root of the document files.
%	They go in here in the
%	following format:
%	\usepackage[options]{package}

%	Including the package "epigraph" allows quotes to be added at the
%	beginning of each chapter or section.
\usepackage{epigraph}

%	The following two usepackage statements MUST be included for the
%	Japanese text found in chapterOne.tex to compile correctly.
\usepackage{CJKutf8}
\usepackage[overlap]{ruby}

%	The following package is required for adding source code listings to a
%	document.
%	At the moment, there is a source code listing in the file chapterTwo.tex
\usepackage{listings}

%	The following package is used for formatting urls in the body and
%	providing a clickable link in the rendered file.
\usepackage{url}

%	The following package is used to parse mathematical characters
%	(used in preface.tex)
\usepackage{mathtools}

%	The above area is called the "preamble"

%	The \begin{document} command informs LaTeX to begin processing
%	the document proper, and that it should no longer receive any
%	\usepackage{} statements
\begin{document}

%	\title, and \author are compulsory.
%	If \date is omitted, LaTeX will put today's date in it's place. The entire
%	section has to be followed by \maketitle, otherwise it will not be
%	formatted correctly.

\title{A Selection of Examples of \LaTeX Code with Discussions}
\author {Jamie Taylor}
\maketitle

%	The abstract, if required, goes in here. It can be renamed from
%	'Abstract' to anything else by using the following command
%	(before the \begin{abstract}, obviously):
%	\renewcommand{\abstractname}{The New Name}

\begin{abstract}

%	The abstract (along with any other document content) can be
%	loaded from another file, using the following command:
%	\input{filename}

%	The above command will add the contents of the file 'filename.tex'
%	into the current document without adding any page breaks.
%	It will look use non-absolute file addressing to find the target file
%	(i.e it will look in the same directory as the current source file)

%	However, the following command will add the contents of a given
%	file between two page breaks:
%	\include{filename}

%	\include{} adds the contents of the file in place, whereas \insert{}
%	will add a page break in place, then add the contents of the file,
%	then add another page break before the content after the command.

%	I am going to include an abstract from a separate file. That way,
%	maintaining the layout of the main document will be easier.
\input{abstract}

%	The following command tells LaTeX that we would like to end the
%	section or command (in this case the abstract)
\end{abstract}

%	Before my table of contents, I want to add a preface. It will be
%	pulled in from the file preface.tex, much like the Abstract was.
\input{preface}

%	The command informs LaTeX to add a table of contents directly
%	where command appears.
\tableofcontents

%	A list of tables and a list of figures can be added in the same way
%	as the table of contents. The following two commands are used
%	to add them.
%	\listoffigures
%	\listoftables

%	The rest of the file can be split into either chapters or sections.
%	Chapter declarations take the following format:
% 	\chapter{Name of Chapter}

%	Whereas section declarations take the following format:
%	\section{Name of Section}

%	Sections, parts and chapters are all added to the table of contents
%	(ig there is one) automatically.
%	They are also numbered automatically. But to add one that doesn't
%	appear in the table of contents and is not numbered, the following
%	command is used:
%	\section*{Name of Unreferenced, Non-Numbered Section}
%	The same can be achieved for chapters by using the following:
%	\chapter*{Name of Unreferenced Chapter}

%	Subsections and Subsubsections can be added in the same way:
%	\subsection{Name of Sub-Section}
%	\subsubsection{Name of Sub-Sub-Section}

%	The first chapter, as with the abstract and preface, will be pulled in
%	from another file. I will still use input, however. This is because the
%	\chapter command uses \cleardoublepage and \clearpage before
%	adding a new chapter. So, there is no need to use \include, just yet.

\input{chapterOne}
\input{chapterTwo}

%	The following command is the final one that LaTeX will see from the
%	main source file. When it sees this command, it will begin processing
%	the document and producing the output.
%	Everything after this command will be ignored by LaTeX

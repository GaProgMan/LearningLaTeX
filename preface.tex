%	The following line ensures that the contents of this file are made

\chapter*{Preface}

All of the text for the different chapters in this document has been pulled in from files (abstract.tex, preface.tex, chapterOne.tex, etc.) that are separate to the main file (source.tex).
\par his is exceptionally useful, as it means that the author can format the original \LaTeX{} document then keep all of the text that will be added to each section/chapter for said document in separate files. In other words, if the author wants to change the content of a single section or chapter, then she need not worry about the impact on the design for the rest of the document.
\par A note on the pronunciation of \TeX and \LaTeX:\\
\indent{}\TeX was originally written, by Donald Knuth, to be used by all writers alike regardless of whether those writers where compiling a technical document, a letter, a manuscript for a book (fact or fiction) or a reference guide for some system or other.
\par To reflect this, the characters used to spell \TeX are not those found in the Latin character set, but the Greek character set. Therefore: the word \TeX is spelt with the following Greek letters:
\begin{math}
\tau, \epsilon and \chi
\end{math}(lower case Tau, Epsilon and Chi, respectively).\\
\indent{}The pronunciation, therefore is based on the Greek alphabet. This means that \TeX is pronounced similar to the (informal) English word ``tech''.\\
\indent{}Similarly, the name \LaTeX is based on \TeX. This means that it is pronounced either "Lay-Tech" or "Lah-Tech". There is no hard-and-fast rule for the correct  pronunciation of \LaTeX (other than the correct pronunciation of the second part, \TeX).

%	This source file uses the \par command. This command
%	instructs LaTeX to insert a new paragraph and typeset the
%	characters which follow after it.

%	Quotes around words and phrases HAVE to use the `` (double
%	backtick) and '' (double use of single quotes) around them. This is
%	because the " (double quotes) character is used elsewhere by LaTeX
